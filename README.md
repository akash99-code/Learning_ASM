### Learning Assembly Language Programming on 8085μ  

This repo presents 16 assembly codes of 8085μ, executed on a assembler simulator - **Microprocessor 8085 Simulator Software Kit 1.0**.  
Each folder contains *snapshot* of the **program**, which contains the **memory image**, **register values** and **flag status** after they are executed.  
The folder also has a document, which describes all the instructions in the program.

**Contents :**
* [P1](/P1) - Immediate Addition of two eight bit numbers.
* [P2](/P2) - Addition of two adjcently located eight bit numbers.
* [P3](/P3) - Addition of two stored eight bit numbers.
* [P4](/P4) - 16bit addition.
* [P5](/P5) - Transferring five blocks of data.
* [P6](/P6) - Finding 1s and 2s complement.
* [P7](/P7) - Generating 2s complement of 5byte data and storing it.
* [P8](/P8) - Masking bits.
* [P9](/P9) - Taking input from a port and output according to the A1 bit.
* [P10](/P10) - Parity check.
* [P11](/P11) - Separating 2 nibbles of 8-bit data.
* [P12](/P12) - Stack opertions.
* [P13](/P13) - Sorting in ascending order.
* [P14](/P14) - BCD to Binary conversion.
* [P15](/P15) - Binary to BCD conversion.
* [P16](/P16) - Multiplication by SHIFT and ADD
